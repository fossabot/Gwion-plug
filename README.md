# Gwion-plug
plugins for [Gwion](github.com/fennecdjay/Gwion)  
actually a Gwion submodule

## Configure
If you're not building from within Gwion, please edit config.mk
so that INC points to a valid gwion include directory.

## make
just *cd* into the directory containing the plug you want to build, and type 
```sh
make
```
## install
while still in a plug directory, try
```sh
make install
```
